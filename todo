Outputs

- Catchment flood characteristics
- Flood risk for given coordinates from rainfall observations, rainfall forecast, pre-determined rainfall events (10 year, 100 year etc..) and custom rainfall event

Intergration to frontend

- Allow front end to query flood risk for device location based on rainfall observations, rainfall forecast, pre-determined rainfall events (10 year, 100 year etc..) and custom rainfall event

**Digital Twin**
Review geojson_converter to confirm new geojson matching working
Rebuild database with new catchment structure
Update digital twin continuous monitoring mode to become always on monitoring tied to API service running

**API**
Add authentication to endpoints
Debug risk endpoint returning - "detail": "No catchment found for provided point"

**Deployment**
Review resource requiements, likley double vps specs
Should we deploy mongoDB in container? Yes
Digital Twin service and api deployed in venv on VPS

Update README and ensure code comments coverage
